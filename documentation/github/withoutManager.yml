        #description: In the case of this github action, we use the rules file located in the rules directory at the root of the project,
        #             we also use secrets for environment variables
        #             in the imaginary configuration of this gitub action, we use email notifications in our rules
        #             in this configuration, we use 2 addOns as examples: github and kubernetes, both of which would have the prefix "DEMO-" in the configuration
        #             we also use the config/kubernetes.yaml file to connect to the kubernetes cluster added before in the previous step
