 *        will instead be available to the feature's experiment, if there is one. Otherwise, all traffic

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { EvidentlyClient, StopLaunchCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-evidently"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EvidentlyClient, StopLaunchCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-evidently"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EvidentlyClient(config);
 * const input = { // StopLaunchRequest
 *   project: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   launch: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   desiredState: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   reason: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new StopLaunchCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // StopLaunchResponse
 * //   endedTime: new Date("TIMESTAMP"),
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param StopLaunchCommandInput - {@link StopLaunchCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link StopLaunchCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link StopLaunchCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link StopLaunchCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EvidentlyClientResolvedConfig | config} for EvidentlyClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient permissions to perform this action. </p>

 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because of request throttling. Retry the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
