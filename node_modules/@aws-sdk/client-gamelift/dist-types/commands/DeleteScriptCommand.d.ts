/**
 * <p>Deletes a Realtime script. This operation permanently deletes the script record. If
 *             script files were uploaded, they are also deleted (files stored in an S3 bucket are not
 *             deleted). </p>
 *          <p>To delete a script, specify the script ID. Before deleting a script, be sure to
 *             terminate all fleets that are deployed with the script being deleted. Fleet instances
 *             periodically check for script updates, and if the script record no longer exists, the
 *             instance will go into an error state and be unable to host game sessions.</p>

 * ```javascript
 * import { GameLiftClient, DeleteScriptCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GameLiftClient, DeleteScriptCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-gamelift"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GameLiftClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteScriptInput
 *   ScriptId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteScriptCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteScriptCommandInput - {@link DeleteScriptCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteScriptCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteScriptCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteScriptCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.

 * @throws {@link InternalServiceException} (server fault)

 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidRequestException} (client fault)

 * @throws {@link NotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>THe requested resources was not found. The resource was either not created yet or deleted.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TaggingFailedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The requested tagging operation did not succeed. This may be due to invalid tag format
 *             or the maximum tag limit may have been exceeded. Resolve the issue before
 *             retrying.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link UnauthorizedException} (client fault)
