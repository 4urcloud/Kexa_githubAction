 * <p>Deletes a specified layer. You must first stop and then delete all associated instances or

 *          <p>
 *             <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Manage permissions
 *       level for the stack, or an attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { OpsWorksClient, DeleteLayerCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-opsworks"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { OpsWorksClient, DeleteLayerCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-opsworks"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new OpsWorksClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteLayerRequest
 *   LayerId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteLayerCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteLayerCommandInput - {@link DeleteLayerCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteLayerCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteLayerCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteLayerCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link OpsWorksClientResolvedConfig | config} for OpsWorksClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that a resource was not found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that a request was not valid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link OpsWorksServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from OpsWorks service.</p>
