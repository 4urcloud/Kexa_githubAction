 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript

 * // const { WorkMailClient, DeleteOrganizationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-workmail"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new WorkMailClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteOrganizationRequest
 *   ClientToken: "STRING_VALUE",
 *   OrganizationId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   DeleteDirectory: true || false, // required
 *   ForceDelete: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteOrganizationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // DeleteOrganizationResponse
 * //   OrganizationId: "STRING_VALUE",
 * //   State: "STRING_VALUE",
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
