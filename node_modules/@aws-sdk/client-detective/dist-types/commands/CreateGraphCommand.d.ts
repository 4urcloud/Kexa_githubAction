/**
 * @public
 * <p>Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the
 *          administrator account. This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective.</p>
 *          <p>The operation also enables Detective for the calling account in the currently
 *          selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new behavior graph.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <code>CreateGraph</code> triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables for
 *          the new behavior graph.</p>
 *          <p>An account can only be the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region.
 *          If the same account calls <code>CreateGraph</code> with the same administrator account, it
 *          always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create a new behavior graph.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { DetectiveClient, CreateGraphCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-detective"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { DetectiveClient, CreateGraphCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-detective"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new DetectiveClient(config);
 * const input = { // CreateGraphRequest
 *   Tags: { // TagMap
 *     "<keys>": "STRING_VALUE",
 *   },
 * };
 * const command = new CreateGraphCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // { // CreateGraphResponse
 * //   GraphArn: "STRING_VALUE",
 * // };
 *
 * ```
 *
