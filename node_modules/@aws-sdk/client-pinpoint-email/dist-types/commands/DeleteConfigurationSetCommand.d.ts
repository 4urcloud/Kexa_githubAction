 * <p>Delete an existing configuration set.</p>
 *         <p>In Amazon Pinpoint, <i>configuration sets</i> are groups of rules that you can
 *             apply to the emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a
 *             reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a
 *             configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to
 *             the email.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { PinpointEmailClient, DeleteConfigurationSetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { PinpointEmailClient, DeleteConfigurationSetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PinpointEmailClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteConfigurationSetRequest
 *   ConfigurationSetName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteConfigurationSetCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteConfigurationSetCommandInput - {@link DeleteConfigurationSetCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteConfigurationSetCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteConfigurationSetCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteConfigurationSetCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link PinpointEmailClientResolvedConfig | config} for PinpointEmailClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link BadRequestException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The input you provided is invalid.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConcurrentModificationException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The resource is being modified by another operation or thread.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource you attempted to access doesn't exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link TooManyRequestsException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Too many requests have been made to the operation.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link PinpointEmailServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from PinpointEmail service.</p>
