 *  <p>You do not have sufficient access to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)

 *             with an internal server.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that a requested resource is not found.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that the principal has crossed the throttling limits of the API
 *             operations.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request failed because it contains a syntax error.</p>
