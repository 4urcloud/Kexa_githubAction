/**
 * @public
 * <p>Deletes the instance of IAM Identity Center. Only the account that owns the instance can
 *             call this API. Neither the delegated administrator nor member account can delete the
 *             organization instance, but those roles can delete their own instance.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SSOAdminClient, DeleteInstanceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sso-admin"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SSOAdminClient, DeleteInstanceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sso-admin"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SSOAdminClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteInstanceRequest
 *   InstanceArn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteInstanceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteInstanceCommandInput - {@link DeleteInstanceCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteInstanceCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteInstanceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteInstanceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SSOAdminClientResolvedConfig | config} for SSOAdminClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You do not have sufficient access to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ConflictException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Occurs when a conflict with a previous successful write is detected. This generally
 *             occurs when the previous write did not have time to propagate to the host serving the
 *             current request. A retry (with appropriate backoff logic) is the recommended response to
 *             this exception.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception, or failure
 *             with an internal server.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>Indicates that the principal has crossed the throttling limits of the API
 *             operations.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request failed because it contains a syntax error.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link SSOAdminServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from SSOAdmin service.</p>
