 * import { FMSClient, DeletePolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-fms"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { FMSClient, DeletePolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-fms"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new FMSClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeletePolicyRequest
 *   PolicyId: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   DeleteAllPolicyResources: true || false,
 * };
 * const command = new DeletePolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```

 * @returns {@link DeletePolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeletePolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.

 *   administrator account and for Organizations before you can access it.</p>
