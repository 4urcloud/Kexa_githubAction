     * 1. Check initial operation result to determine the strategy to use
     *  - Strategies: Location, Azure-AsyncOperation, Original Uri
     * 2. Check if the operation result has a terminal state
     *  - Terminal state will be determined by each strategy
     *  2.1 If it is terminal state Check if a final GET request is required, if so
     *      send final GET request and return result from operation. If no final GET
     *      is required, just return the result from operation.
     *      - Determining what to call for final request is responsibility of each strategy
     *  2.2 If it is not terminal state, call the polling operation and go to step 1
     *      - Determining what to call for polling is responsibility of each strategy
     *      - Strategies will always use the latest URI for polling if provided otherwise
     *        the last known one
